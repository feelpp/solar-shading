This repository provides a basic starting point for a {feelpp} application including:

- [x] {feelpp} applications in {cpp} to use {feelpp} and {feelpp} toolboxes in `src`
- [x] documentation using asciidoc and antora
- [x] python {feelpp} notebooks that can be downloaded from the documentation
- [x] continuous integration including tests for the {cpp} applications
- [x] docker image generation for the project

The documentation for feelpp-project is available at link:https://feelpp.github.io/feelpp-project[here] and you can build on it for your project by enabling the link:https://docs.github.com/en/pages[github pages] for your repository.

== Renaming the project

By default the project is named  `feelpp-project` if you cloned the repository `feelpp/feelpp-project`.
However if you used the previous repository as a template, then the project is renamed using the name of the repository using the script `rename.sh` at the initialization of the repository.
If the name does not suit you, you can change it again using the script `rename.sh` and providing the new name as argument.

WARNING: the script `rename.sh` will rename the project however some url might be set properly if you rename the project yourself. You need to check the following files: `docs/site.yml` and `docs/package.json` and fix the urls after the rename process is done.

== Updating the {project} version

The version of the project is defined in the files `CMakeLists.txt`, `docs/antora.yml` and `docs/package.json`. 
You need to update with the same version in all files.

== Release process

- [x] update the version in CMakeLists.txt
- [x] update the version in docs/antora.yml
- [x] commit the changes with the message "Release vx.y.z". At this point the CI will generate the docker image and push it to docker hub
