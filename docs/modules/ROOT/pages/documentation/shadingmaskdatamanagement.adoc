== Girder

https://girder.readthedocs.io[Girder] is a data management platform developed by Kitware. 

Data can be uploaded or downloaded from Girder using different services: REST API, the web interface, the Girder CLI, the Python Client or JavaScript libraries.

In the Feel++ library, the tool https://docs.feelpp.org/user/latest/using/tools/remotedata.html[feelpp_remotedata] has been developed to download file/folders iteratively from Girder. A https://docs.feelpp.org/user/latest/python/pyfeelpp/core.html[Python interface] has also been provided for this tool.
