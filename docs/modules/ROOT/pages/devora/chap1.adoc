== Ray Tracing

Ray tracing stands as a pivotal computational technique in the realm of realistic light simulation and graphics, especially when high levels of accuracy and detail are essential. In the specific context of computing shading masks, the Perez all weather sky model, and the calculation of view factors, ray tracing is invaluable. It facilitates the tracing of rays from a viewpoint into the scene, allowing for the accurate representation of how light interacts with various surfaces. This is particularly significant when working with diverse atmospheric conditions and intricate urban or architectural structures. Moreover, when integrated with the Monte Carlo technique, ray tracing becomes an even more potent tool. The Monte Carlo method, which relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, paired with ray tracing, enables precise integration over complex domains and distributions. This combination not only enhances the reliability of computations but also expands the scope of scenarios and phenomena that can be realistically modeled and studied.

== Monte-Carlo
:stem: latexmath

In the domain of numerical integration, one can differentiate between deterministic and stochastic methods to estimate integrals. A classic example of deterministic methods is Simpson's rule, which derives its approach based on pairing function values to estimate areas. Specifically, Simpson's rule is defined as:

[stem]
++++
I \approx \frac{h}{6} \left( y_0 + 2\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2}} y_{2i-1} + 4\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} y_{2i} + y_n \right)
++++

where \( I \) is the estimated integral, \( h \) is the width of each sub-interval, and \( y_i \) denotes the function value at the \( i^{th} \) point.

On the other hand, Monte Carlo integration adopts a stochastic method, with each sample resulting in a unique outcome. The integral approximation in this technique is:

[stem]
++++
I \approx Q_N \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{f(x_i)}{p(x_i)}
++++

where \( N \) represents the total number of random samples, \( f(x_i) \) is the function value at the random point \( x_i \) and \( p(x_i) \) is the probability density function at \( x_i \) used to draw the random samples.

But if the chosen probability density function is a uniform distribution, the Monte Carlo integral can be simplified to:

[stem]
++++
I \approx Q_N \approx V \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)
++++

Where \( V \) is the volume of the domain of integration, since \( p(x_i) \) is constant.

[stem]
++++
V = \int_{\Omega} d\bar{x}
++++

Where \( \Omega \) is the domain of integration, a subset of \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

Given Monte Carlo integration's inherent randomness, the outcome is presented as an estimate surrounded by error bars. The efficiency of the Monte Carlo approach enhances with an increase in sample size, anchored by the law of large numbers. This principle posits that as \( N \), the number of samples, approaches infinity, the average result from Monte Carlo will tend to the actual integral value. Consequently, the approximated integral \(Q_N\) is ensured to follow the law of large numbers, with the error bars shrinking as \( N \) increases: 

[stem]
++++
\lim_{N \to \infty} Q_N = I
++++

== Perez all-weather sky model

:stem: latexmath

The Perez xref:partials$bib.adoc#perez-1993-luminance[All-Weather model] is a commonly used mathematical model for predicting the luminance distribution of the sky under various weather conditions. This model is named after its creator, Fernando Perez, who developed it in the late 20th century (1993).

The focus of this part was implementing the Perez All-Weather Sky Model, a complex mathematical framework used for representing the luminance distribution of the sky under various weather conditions. Our implementation leveraged open-source libraries and modern programming paradigms, resulting in a robust solution that readily integrated with existing shading mask computations. Throughout the implementation, we faced several challenges, notably, the complex nature of the Perez model, requiring careful attention to mathematical and physical details. We also grappled with issues of computational efficiency, as large amounts of data in real-time needed to be processed. The implementation was designed to be flexible and widely applicable, specifically in terms of location and time.

The model provides a method of representing the complex, variable nature of the sky's appearance by taking into account several key parameters including the sun's zenith and azimuth angles, the overall level of luminance (brightness) in the sky, the level of clearness, which describes how much the sky is dominated by the direct sunlight as opposed to the diffuse skylight and the level of turbidity, which describes the amount of aerosols or atmospheric particulates, affecting the scattering of light.

It's worth mentioning that, while the Perez model is very flexible and capable of representing a wide range of sky conditions, it is a model and thus an approximation and doesn't perfectly represent all possible sky conditions. Furthermore, it assumes a certain level of homogeneity in the sky conditions, which may not always be the case in reality. For example, situations with localized cloud formations or rapidly changing weather conditions can be difficult to represent accurately with the model.

The Perez model uses these parameters to generate a function that represents the luminance of the sky as a function of direction, or more precisely of the zenith angle of the considered sky element (ζ) and the angle between the sky element and the position of the sun (γ). This function is defined as follows and named \(lv\) in the xref:partial$bib.adoc#perez-1993-geostatistical[Perez model]:

[stem]
++++
lv = f(\zeta, \gamma) = (1 + a \exp(\frac{b}{\cos(\zeta)})) (1 + c \exp(d \gamma) + e \cos^2(\gamma))
++++

The parameters a, b, c, d and e are determined by the level of clearness (ε) and brightness (Δ) as follows :

[stem]
++++
x = x_1(\epsilon) + x_2(\epsilon)Z + \Delta(x_3(\epsilon) + x_4(\epsilon)Z) 
++++

Where x is any of the parameters \(a, b, c, d\) or \(e\), Z is the zenith angle and x1, x2, x3 and x4 are constants and discrete functions of the clearness level ε. The values of these functions are given in the following table (available xref:partial$bib.adoc#perez-1993-luminance[here]):

[]

The goal was to automatically retrieve all necessary data to compute the Perez all-weather sky models for a specific day at a specific date, considerably expanding the range of possible applications of the sky model (averaging values over a different sized ranges, days, weeks, or over different locations). Given a specific day and coordinates, the Perez sky model automatically downloads the diffuse / direct radiation, the normal incident radiation and the sun's postions accross all hours of the day. The Perez model is then computed for each hour of the day where the sun is above the horizon, and each result is stored in a table specifying the hour of the day used for its computation. 

In order to compute the model, we will need to be able to track the sun's position in the sky. This is done using the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), available link:https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/spa/[here].

During the hourly iteration process, several other parameters are computed, such as the sky element's zenith angle and the angle between the sky element and the position of the sun, which is computed thanks to trigonometric functions:

[stem]
++++
\cos(\gamma) = \cos(Z) \cos(z) + \sin(Z) \sin(z) \cos(|A - a|)
++++

Where z is the zenith angle of the sky element, Z is the zenith angle of the sun, a is the azimuth angle of the sky element and A is the azimuth angle of the sun. The zenith angle of the sky element is already known since the hemisphere's discretization is done when the `computePerezSkymodel()` method is called. Everything is automated inside this method, even the computation of the timezone needed to retrieve correct sun positions based on the hours wanted.

Lastly, the Perez model was combined with a shading mask to account for the effect of obstacles blocking the sunlight. The calculation of the shading table involved an element-wise matrix multiplication operation, which required careful handling due to the large size of the matrices involved and the specific organization of data within them. Another key challenge we faced was the interpolation of matrices of different sizes, allowing us to integrate data from different sources, with different spatial resolutions, into our computations. This feature was particularly useful in the case of the shading masks, which are generated using a separate algorithm, and thus may have different spatial resolutions than the ones Perez model. But this algorithm couldn't be used when parts of the shading matrices were totaly in the shadow, because the interpolation algorithm would interpolate the values of the shadowed parts with values of the unshadowed parts, which resulted in slightly wrong shading mask when the dimensions of both matrices were mismatched. This problem was solved by using a different interpolation algorithm that only interpolated the values of the unshadowed parts of the shading mask, for example by defining the boundaries of the shadowed parts, either by directly looking up for zeros in the shading mask table, or by using techniques such as the Sobel operator, able to detect changes in intensity in the matrix, thus defining the edges. 
After execution of the example, available when executing the command `./build/default/src/feelpp_ss_example_ShadingMasks --config-file src/cases/exampleShadingMask/exampleShadingMask.cfg` followed by `python src/visualization/shadingMask_skyModel_visualization.py --dir_path <PATH_TO_SHADING_MASKS_RESULT_DIRECTORY>` in order to be able to visualize the overlay of the shading mask and the sky model. When executing with the example file, we obtain the following results when considering the meteorological data of the 2020-07-22 in Strasbourg, France, when considering the Top of the building named BAT1:

image::skyModelsBat2Top.png[]

The unobstructed view from this location is perfect to verify the accuracy of the Perez model, namely the sun's hourly positions defined thanks to the Solar Position Algorithm, `spa.c`, developped by Afshin Michael Andreas(Metrology Laboratory, Solar Radiation Research Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory). Not only does it enable one to verify the correctness of the fetched data (meteorological data), but it also allows one to verify the correctness of matrix product, even for different sized matrices, as well as an appropriate correlation between the elements of the shading mask, the sky model and the resulting circular mask.

Finally, we'll consider the same example, but this time, we'll consider the top of the first building, Bat1, which lies in the shadow of the second building, Bat2. The resulting shading mask is the following:

image::skyModelsBat1Top.png[]

Seeing the output, namely the cast shadow of the second building on the first one, we can assume that the the unshadowed regions of the mask are showing the Perez sky model directly, and that the interpolation algorithm is working as intended, with slight discrepancies at the boundaries of the shadowed regions, which is to be expected due to the nature of the used spline interpolation algorithm. Below is the building's geometry:

image::2BuildingsMesh.png[]


In order to verify our results, we compared our results with the ones obtained by Andrew Marsh available xref:partial$bib.adoc#marsh-webapp[here]. We tested a case in New York, USA, on the 3rd of March 2020, at 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM. The results are the following:

image::skyModelsNY.png[]

Seeing both ranges of results, we can assume that our implementation is correct, as the results are identical, with a difference of 3-4 W/m^2 due to the fact that the Perez model is an approximation of the sky's luminance distribution and that Andrew Marsh's implementation is using the CIE standard sky model, and a different interpolation algorithm. One should overlook the legend in Andrew Marsh's implementation, as the values are expressed in W/m^2, and not in cd/m^2, as the legend suggests, and when the legend shows W/m^2, it should be understood as the normalization of the irradiance to the maximum irradiance of the sun at the chosen hours. 

Due to the poorly implemented method for computing the timezone difference, some of the results can be slightly off, namely the hours used to compute the suns position in the sky (by a maximum of one hour, two hours if the location is in France, especially offshore during winter/summer times).
The results can be shown as illuminance matrices (lux) as well as irradiance matrices (W/m2), depending on the user's needs. The irradiance is computed from the illuminance, possible since the sun is the only light source in the sky model, by multiplying the illuminance by 0.0083, which is the conversion factor between illuminance and irradiance used by scientists (according to link::https://www.researchgate.net/post/Howto_convert_solar_intensity_in_LUX_to_watt_per_meter_square_for_sunlight#:~:text=The%20LUX%20meter%20is%20used,of%20the%20incident%20solar%20radiation.&text=multiply%20lux%20to%200.0079%20which%20give%20you%20value%20of%20w%2Fm2.[researchgate]). The conversion factor is computed as follows:

The general equation for illuminance:
[stem]
++++
lx = \frac{lm}{m^2} = \frac{lm}{W} \times \frac{W}{m^2} 
++++
Given that the luminous efficacy is about 120/lm/W for sunlight and that the human eye is most sensitive to green light around 550nm, the conversion factor can computed as follows:
[stem]
++++
lm_{SUN} \approx 120 \times \frac{lm}{W} 
++++
Which implies that:
[stem]
++++
lx = 120 \frac{W}{m^2}
++++
And finally:
[stem]
++++
\frac{W}{m^2} = \frac{lx}{120} = 0.0083 \space lx
++++

Where lm are lumens, lx lux and W stands for Watts. This lays out the connection between lux and \(W/m^2\) using the luminous efficacy of sunlight as it relates to human visual sensitivity.
