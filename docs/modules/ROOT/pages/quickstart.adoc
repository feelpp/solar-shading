= Quickstart Guide 

To get started with compiling and using {project_name}, you can either 

- [x] install https://docs.feelpp.org/user/latest/install/index.html[{feelpp} Debian or Ubuntu packages] if you use such systems or 
- [x] use DevContainers in Visual Studio Code as described below.

To get started with viewing and creating documentation, checkout the project xref:env/antora.adoc[Antora] page.

== Using DevContainers in Visual Studio Code

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please ensure that you have https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] and https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] installed before proceeding.
====

=== Getting Started

To start using DevContainers in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
2. A `devcontainer.json` file in the root of your project in `.devcontainer` directory
3. A configuration similar to the following one is available:

[source,json]
----
{
	"name": "Feel++ Dev Jammy",
	"image": "ghcr.io/feelpp/feelpp-dev:jammy",
	"extensions": [
		"ms-vscode.cpptools",
		"ms-vscode.cmake-tools",
		"josetr.cmake-language-support-vscode",
		"asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode",
		"ms-python.python",
		"ms-toolsai.jupyter"
	]
}
----

4. Customize the configuration based on your project requirements. In the example above, the configuration sets the name of the Dev Container as "Feel++ Dev Jammy" and specifies the Docker image to use as "ghcr.io/feelpp/feelpp-dev:jammy". Additionally, it includes a list of extensions to install inside the Dev Container.

=== Opening in DevContainer

To open your project using the DevContainer, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search for and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".
3. Visual Studio Code will build the Docker image specified in the `devcontainer.json` file and open a new window inside the Dev Container.
4. Once the Dev Container is loaded, you can start working on your project within the containerized environment.

=== Benefits of Using DevContainers

Using DevContainers in Visual Studio Code offers several benefits:

- **Consistent Development Environment**: DevContainers provide a consistent and reproducible development environment across different machines, ensuring that everyone works in the same environment.
- **Isolation and Dependency Management**: DevContainers isolate your project dependencies from your local machine, reducing conflicts and simplifying dependency management.
- **Easy Extension Installation**: DevContainers automatically install the specified extensions, making it easy to set up the required tools and configurations for your project.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure your Docker daemon is running and accessible from the terminal to use DevContainers in Visual Studio Code.
